<h2> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-41534552"> BORIS JOHNSON TELLS TORIES TO "GET BEHIND" THERESA MAY</a> </h2>
<p> Now, when I read messages like these supposedly leaked WhatsApp messages from Johnson,<br><i>(Note: Never call him just Boris. It humanises him.)</i><br>I always feel as if they're just a little bit... I don't know. Made up?<br>I mean, I can't actually comprehend the fact that Boris Johnson said "She is right right right". <br> Just seems odd to me, that's all. <br> <br> Wonder if Amber Rudd's in that WhatsApp group, considering her opinion on encryption? <br>Is it all 317 Tory MPs? Can't be - WhatsApp only supports <a href=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/whatsapp-group-chats-bigger-maximum-size-256-people-users-a6856491.html> 256 users in a group. </a><p>

<h2> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-41512796"> IVORY TRADE TO BE BANNED IN UK "TO PROTECT ELEPHANTS" </a> </h2>
<p> Surprised this hasn't happened before to be honest. I personally thought ivory trade was banned - you don't see it as a product anymore<br>for obvious reasons. Well, good for them - shame about everything else. </p>

<h2> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3ODvvITG5B0hecCUFguHl0"> ROBERT WYATT - RUTH IS STRANGER THAN RICHARD NON-REVIEW </a> </h2>
<p> This album is quite good, I'd say. Not Rock Bottom but not much is. Moves in the same way though.<br>Weird thing though - on Spotify the track listing is swapped from the original release, leading to what would<br>have been side A (or "Ruth") on the original vinyl version to be the second half of the album on<br>Spotify. Worth a listen.</p>
