<h2> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-41534552"> BORIS JOHNSON TELLS TORIES TO "GET BEHIND" THERESA MAY</a> </h2>
<p> Now, when I read messages like these supposedly leaked WhatsApp messages from Johnson,<br><i>(Note: Never call him just Boris. It humanises him.)</i><br>I always feel as if they're just a little bit... I don't know. Made up?<br>I mean, I can't actually comprehend the fact that Boris Johnson said "She is right right right". <br> Just seems odd to me, that's all. <br> <br> Wonder if Amber Rudd's in that WhatsApp group, considering her opinion on encryption?<p>
